# Brick_Breaker_Revisited

This is my take of an implementation of the classic game, Brick Breaker, with a twist: what if we have two paddles? Compared to the classic game, some extra features in this implementation includes difficulty selection, more gamemodes and more brick types.

# Progress
The game is complete. More features may be added in the future.

# How to build (Windows)
1. Install Unity Hub on the computer
2. Using command prompt, navigate to the desired location, and enter the command
git clone https://github.com/nexills/Brick_Breaker_Revisited.git
3. Open this folder with Unity Hub.
4. With the project open, from the File tab, select build setting, then build.
