# Brick_Breaker_Revisited

This is my take of an implementation of the classic game, Brick Breaker, with a twist: what if we have two paddles? Compared to the classic game, some extra features in this implementation includes difficulty selection, more gamemodes and more brick types.

# Progress
<<<<<<< HEAD
The game is complete. More features may be added in the future.
=======
While the main body of the game is complete, there are more features planned, such as adding a standard (one paddle) mode for the game.

# Background
As my first side project, I revisited a classic game concept. Adding on this concept, I added several different brick types and implemented 3 different game modes. Each of these game modes can be played with either 1 paddle (classic style) or 2 paddles (the revisited style)
I decided to implement this project with Unity, which is a popular game development engine in the industry. It provides many tools to creators and streamline the creating process. I wanted to take this chance to learn to use this engine, which is a useful skill to have in the industry.
Over the course of this project, I learnt and consolidated concepts in both Unity and C#. I also learnt how to build a graphical interface and make the game presentable.

# How to build (Windows)
